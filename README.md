# BT-2020

This repository contains the code of the bachelor thesis from Long Hoang Nguyen & Georg David Ritterbusch. In the course of the thesis, we explored the open-source web framework A-Frame and its potential to visualize large amounts of data from data warehouses. Our exploration resulted in a tool that allows users to virtually walk through data like in a real warehouse.

## Preview

## Tools and technologies
- Visualization: [A-Frame](https://aframe.io/)
- Backend: [XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html) and [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/)
- Testing: [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/) and [HTC Vive](https://www.vive.com/)

## Setup and usage
* Set up your controllers in case you have some
* Start up the local development environment with XAMPP
* Load the test data:
  * Navigate to `localhost/phpmyadmin`
  * Create a new database `gbi`
  * Import the `gbi.sql`file from the assets folder
* Open `localhost/bt-2020` in Firefox and activate VR mode
* Select the columns you want to investigate and press `GENERATE`
* Navigate through the data with the controllers or your keyboard
